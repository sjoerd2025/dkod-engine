//! In-process counters for the release-locks-at-submit feature.
//!
//! PR1 uses `AtomicU64` counters rather than pulling in a full metrics crate.
//! The values are emitted through `tracing::info!` events with a standardized
//! `metric` field so existing log-based tooling can aggregate them, and the
//! counters themselves are readable from tests and any future Prometheus
//! exporter we might bolt on.
